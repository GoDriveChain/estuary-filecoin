# estuary-filecoin
This is an API interface that allows seamless integration between estuary and FileCoin's blockchain. There are two projects that utilize the estuary API to enable the secure and efficient uploading of public data onto FileCoin and pin it to IPFS.

These projects serve as excellent examples of how to upload and download public files from FileCoin's blockchain. The Python project runs through the command line interface while the C# project has a desktop GUI.
